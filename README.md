# Color-detecting-RC-car_raspberrypi3b-
control of robotic car using openCV, Raspberrypi3b+ and USB camera
Initial idea: Simulating traffic signal control for autonomous vehicles. Controlling 2 DC motors using raspberrypi3 GPIO. Enabling Computer Vision by employing Color Detection algorithm.
using BGR to HSV conversion to differentiate color.
